        <p><strong>Camp Sternberg</strong> was created from a vision to provide Jewish girls with a full
            fledged summer camp experience in 1965 by Rabbi Ronnie Greenwald A’H. Since then it has become
            known to four generations of campers and staff as a camp where each person is cared for as an
            individual. This quality of personal attention has set Sternberg apart from other camps.
            Today the tradition, spirit and integrity of Camp Sternberg continues strong under the
            current ownership of Dov and Allyson Perkal.</p>

            <p>Located in the Pocono Mountains, <strong>Camp Dina</strong> offers an inspiring,
            wholesome, exciting and growth-oriented summer experience for B’nos Yisroel. At Camp Dina,
            we strive to engage our campers in a diversified schedule of activities, where they
            can hone their talents, intellect, and inter-personal middos in our incredible sports
            program, art, music, cooking, drama and wilderness activities – all driven by Torah values.
            Campers and Staff at Camp Dina forge life-long friendships. We are proud of the many campers
            that return to camp each year, and those that return as staff members in an effort to
            positively impact the lives of our campers.</p>

        <p>There is no question that camp plays a prominent role in the development of today’s
            Bais Yaakov girl. Living Torah for two months in a happy, upbeat and positive sevivah
            while being cared for in a safe and warm environment is more crucial for today’s frum
            girl than ever before. Many kids live for camp and it is camp that  helps them get through
            their year.</p>
        <p>Created in 1998, <strong>Raninu</strong> has become the Bais Yaakov Camp that is known for doing
            everything at 110%. This commitment starts with its directors, Rabbi and Mrs. Klein.
            There is nothing The Kleins, and by extension, the entire Raninu staff,
            will not do to make sure each and every girl is well cared for in an amazingly
            positive frum, yet fun environment. Camp Raninu’s staff works hard to nurture
            and cultivate every girl’s individual kochos. We love watching our campers and staff
            thrive in the non-pressured, positive environment we provide in Raninu.</p>

        <p>Give your daughter the summer she deserves. With comfortable bunks, bucolic mountain views,
            a grand dining hall, and gourmet meals, <strong>Camp Malka</strong> is all the best parts of
            sleepaway camp without all the roughing it. Girls completing  sixth through tenth-grade girls
            have the opportunity to make friends from around the world while enjoying sports, swimming,
            boating, arts & crafts, shiurim, trips, fun nighttime activities, and our Shabbos programs.
            We also offer a TC Program for rising eleventh graders, with additional activities, overnights,
            and more. Our supervisors put together a new camp theme every summer, so there’s always something
            fresh and exciting to look forward to!</p>
